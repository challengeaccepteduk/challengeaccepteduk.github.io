    `# Introducing Challenges. The big, the small and personal

#### June 3, 2020 by Steph


## Discover, track and complete your personal challenges with the Challenge Accepted app

Finishing challenges or forming new habits is so difficult because we set way too many and try to do them all at once or set a goal that’s too hard to achieve in one go without the smaller steps and achievements to get there, or sometimes we forget we even started them!

Challenge Accepted’s mission is to give people the inspiration and tools to complete personal challenges, no matter how big or small.

We want you to

- Be inspired to find new challenges by discovering more of what you love
You have passions, don’t forget to explore them and keep them a part of your life.
- Create personal challenges tailored suited to your timeline.
Set yourself reminders in the app for daily challenges so you don’t forget. And remember you can always snooze them and go again tomorrow! Every challenge is a personal challenge so do it at your own pace. You can save challenges you like the sound of for later.
- Challenge friends
Compare challenges with your friends such as your own travel wishlists to decide your next trip, football stadiums to visit, or see if you can both complete a 30 day fitness challenge.


### And please remember...

- Not completing the challenge isn’t failing!
An odd thing to say for a company called Challenge Accepted, but we know that for one reason or another we don’t always finish the challenges we set ourselves. Challenge Accepted should allow you to keep track of them and if you do need to have a break, you can always come back to it.

- Be ok with setting what you might call <i>small challenges</i>.
Whether your challenge is a simple to do list for the day, a 30 day fitness challenge, or working through the latest film challenge. As long as it’s something personal to you, then you’re doing it right.

- Pick a mixture of challenges.
Not everyone has to run a marathon or climb Mount Everest. Great if you can do those things, but we’re just humans trying to get by and have a good time doing it. Try a few different ones to keep it interesting - if you do all the fitness challenges you’ll wear yourself out! Try a mixture of health, hobbies and travel.

### We’re new, and working on our own challenge by making this app better every day, so would love for your feedback on the beta phase of the app how we can improve. Register for beta testing or to be the first to be contacted when we launch.
