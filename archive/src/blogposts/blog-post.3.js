    `# 10 reasons why Yoga with Adriene is our favourite Yoga series

#### 4 June, 2020 by Steph

## If you haven’t tried the Yoga with Adriene videos on YouTube yet, here are 10 reasons you must give it a try.

1. <b> 30 day yoga challenges </b>
There are six 30 day yoga challenges which have been released every year in January so loads to catch up on if you haven’t started yet. Set a reminder in the app so you don’t forget or just pick days you know you’ll have the time.

2. <b>Benji</b>
Don’t even have words for the level of cuteness. 😍

3. <b>It’s free</b>

4. <b>Yoga for absolutely every mood</b>
I honestly think there is yoga for every scenario, yoga for a headache, feeling tired, need energy and or even yoga for equestrians?

5. <b>Yoga to fit into any time or space</b>
Yoga sessions for 10 min periods or a full hour, they’re grouped by how long you have so can squeeze one into every day. Or every space? Yoga for desks, yoga on the airplane and yoga from the couch.

6. <b>Adrienes' inspiring quotes</b>
Including the ‘the awesome in me is bowing to the awesome in you’

7. <b>Going at your own speed</b>
Throughout you are encouraged to ‘find what feels good’ so take a break when you need to, sitting one out or alternative versions depending on how you’re feeling that day.

8. <b>Because every yoga video with a pillow is going to be like a virtual hug</b>
We all love a workout but when the video starts with getting yourself a pillow and blanket for this session you know you are going to come out of it insanely relaxed.

9. <b>You might actually be able to do crow pose with some practice</b>
If you are a beginner, it may seem this is some crazy-witchcraft-strong-jedi pose. But apparently not, being taken through the right way to start and a little practice, it is actually possible for the normal human. Maybe get a friend to help you practice if you have the nerves.

10. <b>And Benji again obviously.</b>


To help you stick to and complete the 30 day yoga challenges we’ve added all five to the Challenge Accepted app with the ability to set reminders to carve out a little time for yourself and Yoga with Adriene at times and days that suit you.
