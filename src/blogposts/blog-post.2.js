    `# Why we love challenges that are 30 days

#### 4 June, 2020 by Steph


1. <b> It’s a short and reasonable amount of time to commit to something. </b> New Year’s challenges are often so hard as you are immediately trying to change something for a whole year and p.s. you’re allowed to change your mind and get bored - they’re your challenges, no one else’s so you have the luxury of doing so. With 30 day challenges you can pick challenges which are relevant for you at that time and mix them up. For instance for keeping fit you might do a 30 day walking challenge followed by 30 day abs challenge or 30 day press up challenge. These are only tiny moments of your day for 30 days, don’t get bored of them, achieve it, and try something new.
2. <b>They are great for forming new habits. </b>
Traditionally said from the 21 / 90 rule it takes 21 days to form a habit, and once established if you can do it for 90 days, just 3x 30 day challenges, then it’ll become a permanent lifestyle change.
However, according to Phillips Lally - Health researcher at UCL, it takes a little longer, approximately 66 days with up to 254 days until fully formed.
30 day challenges, can help you with the initial forming of a new habit be to get yourself over the first hurdle! This could be support with giving something up like smoking, alcohol, meat etc or starting something such as doing 30 minute walk every day minimum, particularly helpful whilst so many of us are working from home
3. <b> You dont need to go cold turkey </b>
If you are doing a 30 day challenge to quit something it’s not the end of the world if you do cheat, we are only human after all, but being honest with yourself helps. Mark down the days you did give in, and keep going forward with marking the days positively where you can
4. <b> 30 day challenges don't have to be done over 30 days </b>
Sometimes you just can't. It's your challange, it should be fun, it should be helpful. If you’ve committed to a 30 day workout challenge for instance and your reminder goes off to do your 40 press ups and you really aren’t feeling it, SNOOZE, the challenge will still be there tomorrow, and we’ll remind you again tomorrow so just take a rest day if you need to. Particularly with fitness challenges where you really need to be looking after yourself and responding to how your body is feeling that day.
5. <b> 30 day chaleges aren't just for fitness </b>
You can use the 30 day template to try loads of new things that stretch you such as:

<b> 30 day be kind challenge </b>
Write down one thing a day you’ve done to be extra kind to someone around you. It’s so easy to be in our own heads sometimes we need a little reminder from talking to a neighbour, calling a grandparent, listening to someone’s problems - just a few minutes day to help someone else makes a huge difference.

<b>30 day vegan challenge</b>
Going vegan, not just for January. Find a good time to try it, give it a go for 30 days and see how you feel by the end of it. What differences did you see in yourself, did you feel or did you save?

<b>30 day taking a lunch break challenge</b>
According to research by Totaljobs, more than half of people don’t take their lunch breaks. Taking a break is so important, not only for the benefits for your own mental health but just google the benefits of taking a break and you’ll find hundreds of studies on how it can improve your productivity, creativity - all that good stuff that makes you better at your job. You probably know this already and just need that extra daily reminder to make sure you do it.

<b>30 day drinking water challenge</b>
This often feels like the most annoying challenge, as it sounds so damn easy. It can be tricky to track so maybe check out the 2L bottles of water and fill it every morning and tick off on the list when you’ve finished it.

<b>30 day reading challenge</b>
Maybe find the time to finish the part-started book on your shelf. You just need to make that regular time for yourself each day.
Read for 20 minutes
Read 20 pages a day

<b>30 day dooodle challenge</b>
Draw something, anything, whether you’re good at drawing or not, when did you get so sensible you stopped drawing silly things on the corner of your pages. From tiny little hearts on your work books to starting a new sketchbook with a doodle every day - it’s fun, there’s no rules but to doodle absolutely anything that springs to mind.

<b>30 day me-time challenge</b>
Instead of setting a specific challenge, maybe just set aside a bit of time for you each day to do something for you; reading a book, doing your nails, making yourself a healthy meal. But chance to take a break and take a moment for some self love.

<b>30 day new album challenge</b>
As much as listening to Beyoncé every single day is totally understandable and relatable to set you up for a good mood day. Maybe check out a new artists work or even old classics you’ve never gave a chance to. Enjoy it from start to finish rather than just the big songs.

<b>30 day happiness challenge</b>
This is about writing down that one thing today that made you smile. ‘A day without laughter is a day wasted’ - Charlie Chaplin. Find that thing that made you smile or laugh and write it down - don’t forget you’re happy moments of the day.

<b>30 day social media break</b>
Social media has so many great aspects like feeling close to friends and family that are far away from us. But there’s also a lot of negativity. So with some social media accounts we might actually feel worse. Look after your well being and test yourself with a little break to see how you feel. If it makes no difference then carry on, but if you are generally feeling happier, less stressed or finding more time for other things you enjoy then maybe give yourself a new routine that means checking social media accounts less.

<b>30 day yoga challenge</b>
We’ve already written a blog post about the love of Yoga with Adrian 30 day challenges but there are more to discover. You can even create your own based on how you feel that day. Maybe set a challenge to do one yoga YouTube video a day and start your search with ‘Yoga for… mornings, headaches, running etc.’

<b>30 day fast food holiday</b>
If you’re getting that extra spot on your face from a few too many fast food trips maybe see how long you can go without it. Take note on how you feel after, how does your skin look, did you save money?

<b>30 days of only drinking water</b>
This is the next level from the ‘days without alcohol challenge’ do you think you could go 30 days with only water. No tea, no coffee, or fizzy drinks.


There are so many more, we’d love to hear your ideas so please share any ideas you have with us either on Twitter or Facebook or email us at ideas@challengeacceptedapp.com
Also remember, you don’t need to stop at 30 days, there are loads of calendar challenge templates on the app to extend your task ongoing and simply close when you are good and ready.

Good luck!
