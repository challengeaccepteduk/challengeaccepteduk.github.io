            of our own challenges and tracking them in many different ways from a scratch map for travel,
             a list on our phones for books to read that year, a 30-day squat challenge app, an app to track
             football stadiums visited, starts on our Google maps for restaurants we wanted to visit, together
              attempting to climb all 7 mountains around Bergen, and many more. Like many people we know, had a
               million and one personal challenges we were trying to complete but had no one place to keep track
               of them all, so we were unlikely to finish them or even forget we started some.

        Our new challenge became creating an app to help us track and

                      Steph, given her background
                      in brand and marketing across large tech companies and a start up app,
        took on the role of scoping the app design, defining the brand and business plan. Along the way having
         to pick up some new skills from finance and legal to brushing up photoshop skills. Paul, who has a
         background of programming at large tech, gaming, fitness and telco companies, developed the website,
          app and CMS from scratch and managed all the product testing. This required learning additional programming
           languages and new programming skills along the way.<br/>
