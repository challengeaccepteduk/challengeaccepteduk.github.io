## The Challenge Accepted app helps people discover, track and complete all their personal challenges in one place. Such as:
**Health & Fitness challenges** e.g. 30 day squat challenge or 30 day cardio challenge<br/>
**Passion challenges** e.g. see every premiership football team <br/>
**Challenges to do at home** e.g. 30 day yoga challenge or crafting ideas<br/>
**New habits** e.g. cut down on drinking or get 30mins of exercise a day <br/>
**Custom challenges** e.g. 12 books I'm going to read this year <br/>
    

## Business model

For partners, this means a new route to talk to customers knowing that we’re aligning them with users who are passionate about their product or industry. Brands can partner with Challenge Accepted to create their own company challenge, sponsor challenges or categories, and promote deals to customers that help with their passions e.g. a cinema offer to help users complete their film challenge.
