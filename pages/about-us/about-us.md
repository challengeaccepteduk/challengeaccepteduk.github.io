## Challenge Accepted is the app to help people discover, track and complete their personal challenges. Such as:
**Fitness challenges** e.g. 30 day workout <br/>
**Passion challenges** e.g. see every premiership football team <br/>
**Travel challenge** e.g. visit every city in Europe <br/>
**Custom challenges** e.g. 12 books I'm going to read this year <br/>
    

## Business model

For partners, this means a new route to talk to customers knowing that we’re aligning them with users who are passionate about their product or industry. Brands can partner with Challenge Accepted to create their own company challenge, sponsor challenges or categories, and promote deals to customers that help with their passions e.g. a cinema offer to help users complete a film challenge.
