Challenge Accepted is a new free motivation and lifestyle app, launched in July 2020 and created by <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulsjohnson91/'>Paul Johnson</a> and <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephaniemandeville/'>Steph Mandeville</a> to help people discover, track and complete their challenges all in one place. Be it 30-day fitness challenges, reading lists, creating new habits and more.<br/> 

We are on a mission to give people the inspiration and tools to complete personal challenges, no matter how big or small. There are hundreds of challenges on the app for people to start immediately as well as the ability for people to create their own list or calendar challenge to start new habits.  <br/>

In August 2020, Challenge Accepted won Small Business Sunday (SBS) by BBC Dragon and Retail Entrepreneur Theo Paphitis and has since grown to over 1,000 downloads.<br/>
