      <h1>Challenge Accepted creates fun and engaging challenges for people to take part in from health and fitness to travel, theatre and more. We help thousands of people stay motivated with what they start.</h1>
      <h2>Supporting marketing campaigns on Challenge Accepted</h2>
      <p>We take a different approach to supporting your campaign from traditional adverts. We can work with you to create an engaging branded challenge on the app that's focused on your customers having fun and taking on a challenge for something you are both passionate about.
      <br/><br/> üöÄ Engage your audience with a bespoke challenge on the app
      <br/> üè∑Ô∏è Help people complete their challenge with an offer for your brand
      <br/> üéØ Target people based on their interests, not demographics
      <br/><br/> To find out more about branded challenges and to discuss how we can support your marketing campaign, please <a href="/contact-us">get in touch</a> with us. </p>
      <h2>Supporting UK charities</h2>
      <p>Since the launch of Challenge Accepted in July last year, we've had over 1,000 people participate in virtual fundraising challenges on the app from UK charities including:</p>

      <div class="scrollable-table-outer wrapper">
      <table class="scrollable-table-inner">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="/Partners/bhf-logo.png" alt="British Heart Foundation" /></td>
            <td><img src="/Partners/tct-logo.png" alt="Teenage Cancer Trust" /></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="/Partners/su2c-logo.png" alt="Stand Up To Cancer" /></td>
            <td><img src="/Partners/shine-logo.png" alt="Shine Cancer Support" /></td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      </div>

      <p>We can support UK charities by hosting fundraising events on the app to help participants keep track and stay motivated throughout the campaign.
