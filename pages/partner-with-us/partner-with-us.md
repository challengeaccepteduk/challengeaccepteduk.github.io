## Supporting UK charities

Since launch, we've had over 13,000 people take part virtual fundraising challenges on the Challenge Accepted app.

We support UK charities by hosting virtual fundraising events on the app to help participants keep track and stay motivated throughout the campaign.

If you are a registered UK charity <a href="/contact-us" className={link}>get in touch</a> with us to see how we can support your virtual fundraising challenges.

## Looking to discuss a partnership for your business?

We've worked with the likes of Costa Book Awards to trial other themed challenges on the app and are always keen to test new ideas.

If you've got an idea for a branded-partnership <a href="/contact-us" className={link}>reach out to us</a>, we'd love to talk more.
